# OPERATING SYSTEM ALGORITHMS (JAVA) 

## Inside each of these files are Java code to simulate Job operation. 
### Users are required to input 
### i. Arrival Time (of each job)
### ii. Service Time (of each job) 

## Results will be categorized in 3 manners
i. Best case scenario (sorted in manner for fastest execution)
ii. Worst case scenario (sorted in manner for slowest execution)
iii. Current case scenario (user-entered execution of tasks)

## Each of the scenario will output
i. List of turn around times for each job (Cumulative service time - Arrival Time) 
ii. List of waiting times for each job (Time job completed - Arrival Time - Service Time)
iii. Average Waiting Time (Mean of turn around time for THE scenario) 

## OS algorithms are divided into 
i. Preemptive (Able to interrupt a job, each job executed could be interrupted based on Algorithm's priority) 
ii. Non Preemptive (Not able to interrupt a job, each job executed must be completed before another can start)
